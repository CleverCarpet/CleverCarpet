# CleverCarpet

Hello code stalkers, I am Clever AKA Austin, I am a 14 Year old software and hardware engineer (In my opinion). I work with Computers, Linux, Phones, and mainly Software.

## About Me

I started to take an interest in electronics and software around the age of 9 when I would tamper with hardware and screw around on the internet with things like scratch and other block coding platforms, this evolved into taking apart disecting websites and teaching myself how HTML worked.

I was diagnosed with ADHD very young, this has greatly impacted my education and ability to learn, but I try to overcome these issues. I struggle with traditional learning teqniques and it's extremly hard for me to focus when trying to learn and I will get distracted by anything. The way I learn is very unique and everything has to be perfect for me to work on anything outside of something that I enjoy a lot or want to do.

When creating projects, I work on things that I think should exist or I want to make. With these projects if they are going to be something I share publicly I keep the community in mind and think about the people like me. I don't create my projects to make money. Most of the times my projects will be open source and avaliable to people who need it and if it helps them they can donate to help me out. I make my projects for people not money.

I Specialize in Node.JS, Javascript, HTML5, and some CSS. I mostly taught myself the fundamentals of Javscript by disecting webpages and js programs and using trial and error to test how things work. I would go through documentation and look through modules and libraries to understand how they work. This gave me a different look at programing and development because it gave me the creativity I needed to create my work and learn more everyday.

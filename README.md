# CleverCarpet

Hello code stalkers, I am Clever AKA Austin, I am a 14 Year old software and hardware engineer (In my opinion). I work with Computers, Linux, Phones, and mainly Software.

## About Me

I started to take an interest in electronics and software around the age of 9 when I would tamper with hardware and screw around on the internet with things like scratch and other block coding platforms, this evolved into taking apart disecting websites and teaching myself how HTML worked.
